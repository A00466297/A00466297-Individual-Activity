Hello there! My Name is Sharlene Wadhwa. I love travelling and have always fallen in love with every new country I've been to, however my experience visiting Kenya will abe my forever favourite. 
From the wildlife Safaris to the breakfast buffets, from the lovely fishing weather to the people of Kenya and their music, the whole adventure was beyond amazing.
