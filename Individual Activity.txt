Hello there! My Name is Sharlene Wadhwa. I love travelling and have always fallen in love with every new country I've been to, however my experience visiting Kenya will abe my forever favourite. 
From the wildlife Safaris to the breakfast buffets, from the lovely fishing weather to the people of Kenya and their music, the whole adventure was beyond amazing.
Kenya was a breathtaking experience. Driving through the forests and watching animals in their natural habitats was very peaceful. The views of the grazing antelope and Jackals feeding on carcases was fascinating. 
We took a short boat ride on Lake Nakuru as the locals taught us how to catch fish with our bear hands. we halted near an island and seen graceful pink flamingos and giraffes everywhere, it was a gorgeous sight.
